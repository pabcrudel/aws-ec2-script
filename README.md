# AWS EC2 Script

This project was suggested by [Jorge Lopez](https://github.com/jorloque) who was
my teacher of Developing Environment and Web Applications Deployment.

You can create a EC2 Instance with the AWS Console however, I prefer to do it by
a script. Here you can see 2 ways to face this challenge:

- Cloud Formation yml
- AWS CLI bash script
